#### Summary
A Meson build system implementation for GLFW v3.3.7

##### History
Converting GLFW to the Meson build system is something of an outlier from the others, as it began before I conceived the experiment. As such, certain data are missing—log entries, for example—as well as accurate metrics of elapsed time. Even the git records are somewhat truncated as I (embarrassingly) broke my git repo partway through. Fortunately, I kept a changelog, so there's no need to suffer through my picayune commits.

Officially, the glfw-meson project began on 22 April 2022 with the first operable (Linux/X11) release—tagged v0.0.0—occurring only a few days later. This particular version was lost when I broke my repo, but release v0.1.0 followed shortly afterward on 30 April 2022.

##### WrapDB
As of 2022/05/23, glfw-meson is officially part of the Meson WrapDB!

##### Thanks
Thanks to elibrokeit and lattis from the #mesonbuild IRC channel on OFTC, because without eli's patience and lattis' previous work, both this and the WrapDB versions would have taken much longer and been a mess.
